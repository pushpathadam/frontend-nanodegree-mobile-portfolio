# Part 1 Optimizations for Page Speed Insights

## fonts & stylesheets load time for minified files
    opensans 52ms
    style.css 311ms
    print.css 203ms
    These were moved inline.

## Image Compression
    pizzeria 115x75 3kb -> ok for smallest phone, sucks above breakpoint 480px .. manually shrink to 480x360 with progressive compression to 10kb
    profilepic.jpg 70x70 5kb
    Added a further optimization as part of gulp workflow.

## Renderblocking Javasript
     Made analytics.js load async &  https too

## Issue with inconsistency between renders and PageSpeedInsights preview
    1. google api works but is slower
    2. hardcoded is faster but pulls in a default system font on the preview

    After discussing it in a one one...seems to be a google bug.



# Part 2 Optimizations

## General
    1. Replaced querySelectorAll faster selectors like getElementsByClassName or getElementById

## Reduce times to Resize Pizzas
    1. move all the calculations except new width assignment out of the loop
    2. assignments of common variables used to calculate width are done once outside the loop since all the pizzas are the same
    3. Extracted basicLeft attribute in one go and stuffed it into an array to use later.
    4. Reduced phase steps calc to the minimum 5 ie mod 5. Save them into an array too.
    5. Use css translateX to repo pizzas


## Optimize Update Positions
    1. Reduced Number of floating pizzas from 200 to 50
    2. Removed most calculations out of the loop that recalcs the background pizzas.
    3. Moved static style calcs to css sheet
    5. speedup scrolling moving static calculations out of the loops
    5. moved scrollTop out of the loop 19.5 ms to 0.5 ms

## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!


####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js.

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
